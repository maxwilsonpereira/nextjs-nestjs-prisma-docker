#### NestJS

One could say that NestJS is to Node.js what Next.js is to React. Both NestJS and Next.js are designed to make development faster, easier, and more productive by providing a structure and set of conventions for building applications in their respective ecosystems.

NestJS is a framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications using Node.js. It provides a set of features and tools to simplify and accelerate the development process, such as dependency injection, middleware, controllers, and more.

Similarly, Next.js is a framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated React applications. It provides a set of features and tools to simplify and accelerate the development process, such as automatic code splitting, server rendering, static exporting, and more.
